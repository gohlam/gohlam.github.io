* Getting Org

Org is an Emacs mode, so you need Emacs and the Org package.

** Emacs

 + Windows :: get emacs
 + Mac :: Use ports
 + Linux :: get emacs

** Org-mode

 + Windows :: get org files by doing something
 + Mac :: Use ports
 + Linux :: get org files by doing something

** Useful configurations

It's all emacs, so configuration is done in your =~/.emacs= file.

*** Wrapping lines

*** Export Settings

* Sections, Subsections, Lists, and Formatting

It is plain text, so a section is set up with an asterisk =*= at the start of
a line, a subsection is two asterisks =**= at the start of a line, etc.

A bulleted list is started with any of a dash =-=, a plus =+=, and
sublists are just indented.

A numbered list is started with numbers.  Sub-lists with numbers are
intented one or more spaces.
